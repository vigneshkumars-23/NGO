            <h3>Reaching to the depths</h3>
            <p>This initiative of ours aims to reach the broader spectrum of society which does not end with kids in cities or towns but we aim to reach the ones living in extremely rural condition, the tribes or the adivasis. In this we aim to give the children education and also give their parents an incentive to send them to schools. We aim to achieve this by providing nutritional meals in the school thus not only do the students get good education but also a healthy and balanced meal keeping them healthy. This would also help the daily wage working parents save costs on meals and thus give them more of reaason to send their kids to school. We also aim to create awareness among parents on why their kids deserve education and how it could just make their lives much better.

    <h3>Teach For India (TFI)</h3>
    <p>TFI is an ngo program that came has been in existence since 2009. This was a major success since its inception. Teachers volunteering here or even those looking for jobs accept very meagre salary or sometimes none at all, they enable holistic development for students making them more aware of the things the society can potentially offer them. Our NGO is proud to announce that we too have involved ourseleves in this outstandig program and we are looking to host sessions for volunteer training across various cities in the country and after training send them to different camps across several villages and hope to make a difference in the lives of children. The inaugral event is being held on 30th of November and the camp goes on for a week and the teaching session for the kids in villages goes on for about 30-40 days.</p>
